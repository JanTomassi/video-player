* A simple Video player
Using Libav, pthread and SDL I was able to implement a simple video/stream player,
that uses a producer consumer arch, I have set the shed to OTHER because
the RT shed need to run as root, or you need to give the compiled file the
permission to run RT threads, this is done with
#+begin_src sh
  sudo setcap CAP_SYS_NICE+eip ./vb 
#+end_src

** Input format
Any format supported by Libav can be opend, even live stream from device camera

** Flags
- h print the usage of the programm
- d set the file or stream to read from
- f set the video format (only for live video)
- r set the framerate (only for live video)
